  <h1> All About Me! </h1>
  <h4> Biography </h4>
  <p> I'm 19 years old and obsessed with dogs, ice cream, and the beach. Currently, I am a full time student at Florida Gulf Coast University, majoring in mathematics. While this webpage is my first independent creation, I have sufficient experience using Microsoft Office and various Google applications. I never really thought I would end up as a math major, but here I am living the math major life. I am originally from Monmouth County, New Jersey... shoutout to the Garden State! I stumbled upon FGCU on the way to the airport from Marco Island, where I was on vacation with my parents. Leaving behind the brutal New Jersey cold for sunshine, humidity, and palm trees was a no brainer.</p>
  <h3> My Best Accomplishment Thus Far: Getting into college and maintaining a 3.5+ GPA </h3>

  <h1 style= "color: DeepPink;"> All About Me! </h1>
  <p> Currently, I am a full time student at Florida Gulf Coast University, majoring in mathematics. While this webpage is my first independent creation, I have extensive experience using Microsoft Office and various Google applications. I never really thought I would end up as a math major, but here I am living the math major life. I am originally from Monmouth County, New Jersey... shoutout to the Garden State! I stumbled upon FGCU on the way to the airport from Marco Island, where I was on vacation with my parents. Leaving behind the brutal New Jersey cold for sunshine, humidity, and palm trees was a no brainer. </p>

  <h2> Biography </h2>
  <p> I'm 19 years old and obsessed with dogs, ice cream, and the beach. Currently, I am a full time student at Florida Gulf 
    Coast University, majoring in mathematics. While this 
    webpage is my first independent creation, I have sufficient 
    experience using Microsoft Office and various Google applications. 
    I never really thought I would end up as a math major, 
    but here I am living the math major life. I am originally from 
    Monmouth County, New Jersey... shoutout to the Garden State!
    I stumbled upon FGCU on the way to the airport from Marco Island, 
    where I was on vacation with my parents. Leaving behind 
    the brutal New Jersey cold for sunshine, humidity, and palm trees was a no brainer.</p>
